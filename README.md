Bettit (stands for better archives for Reddit) is an archival web service for Reddit.

Reddit hosts countless threads of valuable information.
Unfortunately that information is trapped behind a heavy web bundle, with long load times and an opinion dividing user experience.
Bettit aims to solve this problem by allowing users to archive Reddit threads as plain HTML-files,
increasing the availability of information to people with slow connections or little patience.
